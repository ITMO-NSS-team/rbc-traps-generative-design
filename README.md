# Single Red Blood Cell Hydrodynamic Traps Via the Generative Design

This is the repository for the paper "Single Red Blood Cell Hydrodynamic Traps Via the Generative Design" published in Micromachines journal.

In the paper, the evolutionary approach implemented in [GEFEST](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/GEFEST) framework was applied to optimize the structure of geometrically-encoded cell traps.

*Experiments* folder contains the scripts that run the optimization for the described case.
*Setup* contains the wrapper for the COMSOL simulator and the configuration for the simulation environment.
*Results* folder contains the structure of best obtained configuration.
